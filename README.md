# Telegram Bot - Automated Payment Solution

## Summary

The client owns a business that sells logins to a subscription service. At the moment the customer sells this service through telegram, but manually. When their customer contacts them to purchase a subscription service the client has to login to their website and manually create them a login to access their service.

The bot is basically a bot for people to purchase a login for a subscription service via a website automatically for the client rather than them having to do it all manually, but it is all done through this telegram bot.
